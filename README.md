## App Objective:

As food connoisseurs, we understand that there are some of them that are willing to try recreating good food themselves to consume. However, individuals like us aren't aware of the paramount difficulty of making good food, causing them to lose motivation to 
begin their culinary journey. Therefore, with the help of our app, not only will beginner chefs be inspired to start cooking, but chefs from all skill levels will also be inspired to view the variety of recipes that they could try and cook for themselves. This app provides recipes from all kinds of cuisines, providing people a single-app solution when trying to search for recipes to make.

Stage 1:

1. Account Creation/Login(Ryan)
   - This feature will ensure that users are provided a secure and personalized experience when trying to make use of our app. When they create an account, they will be provided a list of checkboxes that indicate certain food allergies before being able to view recipes and culinary techniques that they want to learn.


3. A Scroll Display of Recipes:(Yan Hui)
   -  This feature is tailored towards all users trying to find unique recipes to make good food with. This feature will provide users on the various recipes we have on our app. These recipes will be displayed in a visually appealing, scrollable format, providing culinary inspiration to users. When they click on a certain recipe, they will be given a detailed run-down of the recipe, providing users with the list of ingredients required, along with nutritional information for each information like the amount of calories, protein, carbs and fats. On top of that, they will be provided a horizontal scrollable format of the instructions for the recipe, meaning that they can simply scroll to the right to move on to the next instruction.

4. Dietary Restrictions(Jun Hao):
   - This feature is tailored towards users that may have certain dietary restrictions like food allergies. In this case, upon account registration, users will be able to key in their 'said' food restriction.

5. Grocery List (Shan Chun)
   - When users look for recipes on our app, they may have get overwhelmed by what ingredients they have to purchase. Typically, they will use a "Notes" app in order to keep track of that. However, in our app, we provide an in-built grocery list such that it provides them with a 'One-stop solution', meaning that they won't have to keep switching between other apps. Users will be able to manually add and delete ingredients that they require. This can overall make their shopping process a bit more streamlined.

6. Culinary Technique Tutorials (Ashton)
   - When beginner chefs are trying to follow recipes, they may end up being overwhelmed by the amount of skill required and especially if its their first time trying to replicate the technique. Therefore, with this feature, it provides them video evidence on how typical restaurant chefs manipulate such techniques in order to maximize the quality of the food product. Each technique tutorial will provide insights on the importance of this technique and how it can boosts the quality of the food product. On top of that, a video will be displayed to the users so that they can view the technique in action, done by professional chefs.
